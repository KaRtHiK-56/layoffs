# layoffs
This is a data analysis project of recent trends that is going on in the industries regarding layoffs, So everyone could get a knowlwdge on whats happening around Industries.

Since this is a data analysis project, I have followed few basic steps that is involved in the Data Science life cycle process. 

**Business Requirement:**

Recently a lot of companies including big giant tech's has been laying off employees to manage with this inflation. Layoffs is a temporary or permanent discharge of a worker or workers because of economic conditions or shortage of work. It is the result of imitative behavior and not completely evidence based. One of the major reasons that led to this decision is Covid-19 (Spread of corona virus) that started to happen from the start of January 2020, which impacted this worldwide lockdown and curfew which impacted a lot of business of many companies. As in turn many companies started to lose their grip in the business holdings, stake holders and losing capital that affected to yield profit to run companies. So, in order to manage this unexpected inflation and its connected chains companies chose to lay off its employees. So, the requirement that is required now is to analyze the trends that is recently going on with the industries and to analyze how companies have laid off its employees by gathering meaningful insights and knowledge of recent trends that is happening in industries regarding this layoff's. 

**Data Gathering:** 

This is the second step that involves in the data science life cycle process. After the problem statement is framed the next step that involves is a data gathering. This took a while to gather data's by researching many articles which eventually led to a website that has the information of all the data with respect to lay off from 2020 to 2023 ( Layoffs.fyi - Tech Layoff Tracker and Startup Layoff Lists).

**Data Preprocessing:**

Data preprocessing is the process of converting the raw data into a meaningful format. It involves in the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset.

**Feature Engineering:** 

Feature engineering is the process in which we use the meaningful data to create a new feature which can contribute to the machine learning model.

**Feature Selection:**

Feature selection is the process of selecting only the useful feature that will be used for building the model.


Finally this project concludes a brief notes on why it is happening and what we can do to equip ourself with to overcome this layoff.


Initially after the data was collected, I started to understand the data and decided what to do with the data.
Then i started to frame the business requirement fixed the goal,objective and framed all the questions related to layoffs and started to solve it.

I Explored the data at first and then with data cleaning , Exploratory data analysis and decoded all the questions with a conclusion.

For future improvements it is possible to make this project live and also can make a time series analysis on this as layoff predictions.
